#  Book Store Management System
In our proposed project, we will be developing an e-commerce book store website. It will have two kinds of users, firstly the customers who want to buy the books and secondly the vendors who will add books for sale in the website. For both new customers and vendors we will provide the ‘Register’ option and the old users will have to ‘Login’. The customer need not register/login if they are just viewing the books, they need to register/login only if they want to buy the book. Vendor will be provided with the functionality of adding, updating and deleting the books whereas customer has only access to buy the books and customers cannot perform any modification on the books. After the customer has finished ordering the books, he will be provided with ‘Log out’ or ‘Return to cart’ option. Similarly, for the vendor, after finishing the modifications, he will provided with ‘Log out’ option.
